1.Overview
This project focuses on building a full-stack real-time chat application using JavaScript, ensuring instant messaging with WebSockets and managing user authentication using JWT. The application is built with the following architecture:

Frontend: React.js (using Vite for bundling).
Backend: Node.js with Express.
Database: MongoDB for storing user data and chat history.

2.Features
Real-Time Messaging:

WebSocket connections are used for real-time messaging between users.
Supports multiple users in the same chat room.
Messages appear instantly in the chat window without page reloads.
User Authentication:

JWT-based user authentication.
Each user has a unique username or identifier in the chat room.
Non-authenticated users cannot access the chat room.
Frontend:

Built using React.js with Vite for web.
Chat interface displays:
List of users in the chat room.
Chat window with messages and timestamps.
Input form to send messages.
New users joining are dynamically added to the user list.
Backend:

Uses WebSockets for real-time message exchanges.
REST API endpoints handle user authentication and other non-real-time interactions.
Built with Node.js and Express.
Database:

Persistent data storage using MongoDB for users and chat history.




3.Technologies
Frontend: React.js, Vite
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT
Real-Time Communication: WebSockets




4.Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14+)
MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone git remote add origin https://github.com/TanishqMishra1/DataMotion-ChatApp.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd real-time-chat-app
Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

bash
Copy code
# Navigate to backend folder and install dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Navigate to frontend folder and install dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
Set up environment variables:

In the backend directory, create a .env file and add the following variables:
bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Start the frontend server:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm run dev





5.Usage
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to access the chat application.
Log in or sign up to join the chat.
Start sending and receiving real-time messages in a chat room with other users.
Scripts
Backend:
npm start - Starts the backend server.
Frontend:
npm run dev - Starts the frontend in development mode with hot-reloading.





6.Database
The application uses MongoDB as a persistent database to store user data and chat history. The reason for choosing MongoDB (a non-relational database) is due to its flexibility with storing documents like user profiles and chat messages, which can vary in structure. Additionally, MongoDBâ€™s scalability makes it suitable for high volumes of chat messages.

MongoDB vs. SQL:
MongoDB offers flexible schema design and is optimized for high-throughput applications.
SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL) could be used for stricter relational data handling, but MongoDB's document-based model is more efficient for handling real-time data like chat messages.





7.Scalability
This chat application is designed to be scalable with the following considerations:

WebSocket Management: WebSockets handle real-time connections efficiently. In production, load balancing WebSocket connections across multiple instances can be done using tools like Nginx or cloud services.
Database: MongoDB scales horizontally and can handle large volumes of chat data across distributed servers.
Cloud Deployment: The app can be deployed to cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean, ensuring high availability and scalability.
